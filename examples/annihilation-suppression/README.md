# Example: the aggregate tidal scaling factor for annihilation within subhalos

As described in Appendix B of [arXiv:1910.08553](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08553), suppression.py integrates the tidal evolution model over a host halo's phase space. The result is the aggregate factor by which the annihilation rate is suppressed within subhalos of density rho_s inside a host halo of density Rho_s, concentration c, and age t.
