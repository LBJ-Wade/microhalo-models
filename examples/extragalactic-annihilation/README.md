# Example: the extragalactic annihilation boost due to early matter domination

We use the EMD power spectrum power_1GeV_40.txt (corresponding to the scenario with T_RH=1 GeV and k_cut/k_RH=40) to sample the population of microhalos and their asymptotic coefficients A. The annihilation boost factor is then calculated as described in Section III of [arXiv:1910.08553](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08553).
